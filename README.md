# C Math Quiz Game

A terminal-based **interactive math quiz** built in C.  
This project demonstrates core programming skills including **functions, pointers, loops, conditionals, user input/output, randomization, and modular code design**.

---

## Features

- Random arithmetic questions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- 5-question rounds with dynamic difficulty scaling
- Tracks user score and calculates percentage
- Assigns grade based on percentage (HD / D / C / P / F)
- Replayable rounds for continuous practice
- User-friendly terminal interface with immediate feedback

## Skills Demonstrated

C Programming: variables, data types, operators, type casting

Control Flow: loops (for, do-while), conditional logic (if, else if, else)

Functions: modular design, parameter passing, return values

Pointers: updating score inside functions

Randomization: dynamic question generation

User Interaction: scanf, printf, formatted output

Problem Solving: dynamic difficulty scaling, grade calculation
